Audio Only Youtube (Chrome Extension)
=======================================

audio-only-youtube chrome extension enables you to disable only video on youtube songs which saves bandwidth when you want to listen songs on youtube.

#### Installation

[You can install extension from here(Chrome Webstore)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/audio-only-youtube/pkocpiliahoaohbolmkelakpiphnllog)

**Thanks to Stefan Ivic for all the icons used in the extension.**

#### Contribute

1. After cloning the repo,  run `yarn run start`.
2. Open chrome, go to extensions tab, load unpacked extension and select
   `dev/build` directory.
3. Go to Youtube and see extension in live.

In case you edit code, it would automatically rebuild the extension and after
that you need to reload it in the browser.

Good luck!
